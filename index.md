### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 was a good project for me to understand how function calls work. I also became more familiar with how parameters within a function work so that a value can be taken from somewhere else and used within a function. This lab helped me understand that a return statement can be an actual statement using parameters, variables or arithematic equations.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 1 was very tricky, but I felt a nice sense of accomplishment when I completed it. I was able to figure out how to check for times between 6:30 - 7 without accidentally checking only for 7:30 - 8, 8:30 - 9, etc. It was good practice for understanding how multifile programs work too.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 1 was the first time I had to work with ifstream data streams and appreciated the practice it gave. Using for-each loops to iterate through a list of words was a nice pattern use to learn.
